# Bitcoin Sound Visualiser
Sound of the block chain - an audio-visual representation of Bitcoin data


###How to run it
run `composer update` to download the required packages and then simply navigate to the `public` folder and start a simple server with `php -S localhost:80`. You can now access the app in your browser at [http://localhost](http://localhost)

###Why?
this little experiment was created as part of the 2014 Blocktrail Hackathon in Amsterdam. It has no real world applications, but is meerly an abstract and interesting why to "visualise" the data in the Bitcoin network.
